# angularportal

##Synopsis
This project is actually composed of 3 distinct subprojects designed to show
how 2 angular apps can coexist in a 'container' page.
The 3 projects are:
1.  portal - contains a single HTML file which loads the 2 other apps using jQuery
2.  portlet1 - an app generated using angular-cli with a few modifications to
               overcome the issue of 'Zone Already Loaded'
3.  portlet2 - same in nature as portlet1 except that this loads a different sample domain
